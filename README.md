Say Hello with persons name
Peer Review - Freddy Aguilar - the program takes their mini challenge 1 and converts it to API format. It takes the users input and outputs it on Postman in a sentence greeting the user including their name. Code formatted nicely and easy to read. Everything works as intended.



Open up the code then press F5, then it will open the localhost, copy the local host and put it into postman. after that type in the controller name, the route, and the input.

https://localhost:7278/sayhello/hello/{name}
